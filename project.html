        <p>This is a little project I randomly decided to make, it involves connecting an Rf scanner to an Arduino to act as the Input. The Arduino then sends an output to a mini Servo motor and tells it to rotate 90 degrees. I set it up this way so as to act as a locking mechanism.</p>
        <p>I plan to add a few things in the future, one of those being a screen to show when it is "locking" and "unlocking". I would also like to show named IDs for separate Rf IDs used on the screen as an almost account style system; it could be some fun.</p>

        <p>Here is the coding that was used to make the system run. I would like to put it out there that this code is made from a mixture of YouTube videos and the use of ChatGPT.</p>
